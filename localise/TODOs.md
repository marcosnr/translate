# TODOs

List of requirements and tech debt accrued during normal development. (To be addressed at later stage / nice to have if times allows)

- Write instructions to set up Nodejs and npm to build locally, use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)
- Set up redirect and self signed cert for 443 port in localhost, now insecure 80 !
- Find a slimmed down version node image for docker, like `nodejs:16.17.1-alpine`??
- Create a meaningful justification for using docker-compose (e.g. multi-containers), adding a sql server but not really used now?
- Add some basic `Jest` Unit tests
