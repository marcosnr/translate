### Build Status

[![build](https://github.com/marcosnr/translate/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcosnr/translate/actions/workflows/build.yml)

### Lokalise Introduction

Please refer to the [Lokalise Roadmap](/lokalise/Roadmap.md) To understand the rationale behind this Home Task Assignment.

## Introduction

This repo contains a static website utilizing the proceedings of project [Bergamot](https://browser.mt/).

The concept is the same as [Firefox Translation](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/firefox-translations), where the inference occurs entirely in the webpage by utilizing the WebAssembly port of the neural machine translation engine [(marian)](https://github.com/mozilla/bergamot-translator), while the models are dynamically downloaded and loaded as the user switches between the languages.

## Live Demo

The live demo is hosted on Github Pages and published on https://mozilla.github.io/translate.

Compatible and tested on:

- Firefox desktop
- Chrome desktop
- Edge desktop
- Brave desktop
- Firefox Nightly for Android
- Chrome for Android

## Code Guidelines

When working on this project, please bear in mind that:

- Instructions must be as clear as possible, with links for navigation
- Every time you introduce a new tool, include it under resources. If the change is a substantial Infrastructure/Design shift. Attach an [Architecture Design Record](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records) documntation for it.
- Any and every technical debt accrued must be recorded (e.g. transparency and accountability for backlog groming, planning, etc.) See the [TODOs section](/lokalise/TODOs.md) for this.


## Development

### Prerequisites

- For local console
  Nodejs

  ```bash
  node -v
  v16.17.1
  ```

- For containerized version:
  Docker Engine
  ```bash
  docker -v
  Docker version 20.10.8, build 3967b7d
  ```
  Docker compose
  
  ```bash
  docker compose version
  Docker Compose version v2.10.2
  ```

### Console

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start nodejs embedded server
bash start_dev_server.sh
# You should see:
# Start httpserver
# HTTP and BinaryJS server started on port 80
```

Now you can Open Firefox Browser new window and go to your [localhost](http://localhost).
Live version can be found at[mozilla.github.io/translate](https://mozilla.github.io/translate)

- Alternatively by:

```bash
# confirm is working
curl -k -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost/
# Should return OK: 200
# Windows
firefox http://localhost
# Mac OS
open -a firefox -g http://localhost
```

### Container mode

To build the container:

```bash
IMAGE_NAME=translate
echo ${IMAGE_NAME}
docker build --tag ${IMAGE_NAME} .
```

then all you have to do is run it and expose the port:

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 ${IMAGE_NAME} #add -d to have it detached
# Now you can check again in your browser... alternatively:
# check port is listening
curl -v -s http://localhost/ 1> /dev/null # headers only
# see logs
#  when running, do it like:
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -d --rm -p 80:80 ${IMAGE_NAME})
# or with docker ps, and then:
docker logs -f ${CONTAINER_ID}
# if you need to troubleshoot
docker exec -it ${CONTAINER_ID} /bin/bash
```
- Leveraging Docker compose for multicontainer orchestration
This is a scaffolding to create persistence capabilities with a MySQL database, but need actual code to connect to it.

```bash
docker compose up #repeat same steps to see onlin
docker compose down
```

- Tagging and pushing your image (necessary to perform container scanning)

```bash
IMAGE_BASE='translate'
IMAGE_TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
docker build -t ${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG} .
REPOSITORY_NAME=mninoruiz #change this if you want your personal one
echo "Confirm: Local Image name: ${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG} Remote: ${REPOSITORY_NAME}/${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG}"
docker tag ${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG} ${REPOSITORY_NAME}/${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG}
docker push ${REPOSITORY_NAME}/${IMAGE_BASE}:${IMAGE_TAG}
```

- You can also use the available script to publish: [/scripts/publishDockerImage.sh](/scripts/publishDockerImage.sh)

```bash
./scripts/publishDockerImage.sh
```

### CI/CD

This project leverages [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Templates can be found on the [.github/workflows/build.yml](/.github/workflows/build.yml) folder

- If your deployment fails because audit step found a vulnerability, you can try to issue 

```bash
npm run audit 
```

- To get more information, and then `npm audit fix --force` to attempt resolution. We use []() Or reach out to your friendly [DevSecOps engineer](mailto:marcos@mninoruiz.org) that will gladly pair with you to resolve it :smile: 

### Container Vulnerability scanning

To use built in Docker Scan, you need to have a valid login session to DockerHub (obtain one with `docker login` and enter your credentials). Bear in mind you only have 10 free scans a month unless you link it with a Snyx free account as well (using `--token SNYK_AUTH_TOKEN` in the command)

```bash
echo ${IMAGE_NAME}
docker scan --dependency-tree -f Dockerfile ${IMAGE_NAME} # you may add "--exclude-base" for faster scan
```

Nonetheless, there's a dedicated step in the CI/CD pipeline that will publish and Scan containers automatically.
